# BCNN
This project makes a simple BCNNN example. In the "BCNN_VGG16.py", I construct the BCNN based on VGG16 on keras. Meanwhile,  I add a "dimension reduction layer" to the BCNN, which can be seen in "BCNN_Advanced.py". By using "convolutional dimision reduction", the parameters of BCNN become less than before, so I call the new model "A-BCNN".
